<p>Growing businesses often find themselves in the situation where they have two or more existing systems
critical to their processes which cannot talk to each other. In these situations manual processes
are established to manually modify and move data between the systems.</p>

<p>By analysing how these systems work Watford Consulting can help build integration points between
systems, allowing the data critical to your business to flow freely without manual intervention.</p>
