<p class="lead">Software and Systems Integration</p>

<p>Growing businesses often find themselves in the situation where they have two or more existing systems
critical to their processes which cannot talk to each other. In these situations manual processes
are established to manually modify and move data between the systems.</p>

<p>By analysing how these systems work Watford Consulting can help build integration points between
systems, allowing the data critical to your business to flow freely without manual intervention.</p>

<p class="lead">Mixing Off-The-Shelf and Bespoke Software</p>

<p>Often it is not necessary to embark on building completely bespoke software. Common Off The Shelf (COTS)
products will often satisfy the majority of your business needs, albeit with a little customisation.</p>

Watford Consulting can help you identify the customisations you need to make to COTS products
and can build adaptors to those products to have them fit seamlessly into your processes.
